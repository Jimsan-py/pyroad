## That’s all for now

As you may have noticed, there is no mention of control constructs, IDE installation or virtualenv in this guide. In my opinion, all these topics are very important, but do not constitute the essence of the language, representing something like a binding solution, while the topics discussed in the article, from list to Kubernetes, serve as the full-fledged “bricks”.

As a reminder, all the diagrams are made in Mermaid format (you can change the picture just by correcting the text), all the sources are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/amaargiru/pyroad), correct as much as you want, or, of course, leave comments directly in the comments section.

Separately, I welcome all beginner programmers. You will come to realize that working 8 hours in a row using your head and not your hands is hard, too. But, no matter what languages you plan to code in and no matter how far you've come in this difficult task, you will definitely upgrade your brain, improve your understanding of the world around you and start to recognize secret passages where you have seen only impenetrable walls before. So it's time to start the IDE, focus a little bit, and start practicing.

And remember: “This is my Python. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My Python is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.  Without me, my Python is useless. Without my Python, I am useless. My Python and I know that what counts in life is not the words we say, the lines of our code, nor the time we spend at the office. We know that it is the completed tasks that count. We will complete them... My Python is human, even as I'm human, because it is my Python. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts and accessories, its standard library and its infrastructure. I will keep my Python from dangerous misunderstanding or suboptimal use, even as I do my legs and arms, my eyes and heart from any harm. I will keep my Python clean and ready. We will become part of each other. So be it.”
